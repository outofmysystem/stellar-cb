    <i>HOW TO LEARN HTML:</i>
    <P>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the language used to display documents and various creations in a standard browser.
        It’s used by businesses worldwide to power mobile apps, software, and websites — almost 92.8% of all websites.
        Learning HTML will open up countless opportunities for you and your business. You’ll be able to code websites and adjust scripts by understanding basic HTML.</P>
    <br>
    <p>As you learn and understand the required structure of HTML, you’ll be able to recall HTML shortcuts in no time.</p>
    <u>To put it simply: HTML is the foundation for most of the sites you interact with every day. Even this very webpage is an HTML document.

        It is so prevalent across the web that it makes sense for you to know, at least, the very basics of the HTML structure. You never know when it may come in handy.
